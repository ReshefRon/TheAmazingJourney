In 2001, Hapoel Tel-Aviv has been qualified to the Quarter-final of UEFA cup (previous version of UEFA Europa League) and played against the legendary AC Milan in the San-Siro.
In 2011, Hapoel Tel-Aviv has been qualified to the Groups stage of the Champions Leauge and played against Benfica,Olympique Lyonnais and Schalke 04.

I want to gather all these records to one clear display. So I created this map :)
I have TheAmazingJourney.py where I created a temporal dataframe from TRANSFERMARKT.COM and then create the HTML page.
Sincerly, I have another .py (main.py) and I don't remember for which reason... When I will have time I'll check if it's required for something or I can remove it.
